Certainly! On Day 1, we'll start with the basics of web development and create a simple webpage. Here are detailed instructions to get started:

**Day 1: Introduction to HTML, CSS, and Creating a Webpage**

**Objective:** Understand the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and create a basic webpage.

**Tasks:**

1. **Learn about HTML and CSS:**
   - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content of web pages.
   - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and format the content.

2. **Set Up a Text Editor:**
   - You can use any text editor for coding. Recommended editors include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or even Notepad (on Windows).

3. **Create a Folder:**
   - Create a folder on your computer to organize your project files. Name it something like "RobotSimulator."

4. **Create HTML File:**
   - Inside the project folder, create a new file and name it "index.html."

5. **Write HTML Code:**
   - Open "index.html" in your text editor.
   - Write the following basic HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Robot Simulator</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Robot Simulator!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

   - This code defines a simple webpage with a title and a heading.

6. **Save and Open in a Web Browser:**
   - Save the "index.html" file.
   - Open it in a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox) by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and choosing "Open with."

7. **Explore the Webpage:**
   - You should see the title "Robot Simulator" in the browser tab and the heading "Welcome to the Robot Simulator!" displayed on the webpage.

8. **Learn about HTML Elements:**
   - HTML consists of various elements like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, and more. These elements structure and display content on web pages.

**Homework Assignment:**

- Research and experiment with adding more HTML elements (e.g., paragraphs, lists) and applying basic CSS styles (e.g., changing text color, font size) to your webpage.
- Try to understand the purpose of each HTML element and how CSS can be used for styling.

By the end of Day 1, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and have created a simple webpage. This foundational knowledge will be crucial as we proceed to build the robot simulator.
