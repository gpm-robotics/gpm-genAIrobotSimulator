Great! Let's move on to Day 2. On this day, we'll enhance your basic webpage by adding an image of a robot and making it visually appealing. Here are the detailed instructions:

**Day 2: Adding an Image and Styling**

**Objective:** Add an image of a robot to your webpage and apply CSS styling to make it visually appealing.

**Tasks:**

1. **Find an Image:**
   - Search for a robot image online (e.g., a cartoon-style robot). Ensure it's a simple image suitable for your project.

2. **Download the Image:**
   - Save the robot image to your project folder. Name it something like "robot.png" or "robot.jpg."

3. **Edit Your HTML File:**
   - Open the "index.html" file in your text editor.

4. **Add an Image Element:**
   - Inside the `<body>` tag, add an `<img>` element to display the robot image. Make sure to specify the correct path to your image file.

   ```html
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to the Robot Simulator!</h1>
       <img src="robot.png" alt="Robot Image">
   </body>
   ```

   - The `src` attribute should point to the file path of your robot image.
   - The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for screen readers.

5. **Apply CSS Styling:**
   - Add a `<style>` block inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file to apply CSS styles.

   ```html
   <style>
       body {
           text-align: center;
           background-color: #f0f0f0;
       }
       
       h1 {
           color: #333;
       }

       img {
           width: 200px;
       }
   </style>
   ```

   - In this example, we center-align text, set the background color, change text color, and adjust the image width.

6. **Save and Refresh:**
   - Save the "index.html" file.
   - Refresh your web browser to see the changes.

7. **Experiment with Styling:**
   - Try modifying the CSS properties (e.g., changing colors, adjusting image size) to get familiar with CSS styling.

**Homework Assignment:**

- Experiment with different CSS properties to further style your webpage. You can change font styles, background colors, and more to make your robot simulator webpage visually appealing.

By the end of Day 2, you should have added an image of a robot to your webpage and applied basic CSS styling to improve its appearance. This will make your robot simulator project more engaging as we continue to build it.
